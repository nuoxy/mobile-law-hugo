layout: "faq"
faqs:
  - question: "How fast do you respond?"
    answer: "I usually reply the same business day. If a matter is time-sensitive, write “urgent” in the first message and briefly explain why. WhatsApp is the fastest way to reach me."
  - question: "Do you offer free consultations?"
    answer: "No. I provide paid, focused legal advice designed to give you clarity and a concrete next step. That said, after your first short message, I’ll tell you whether I can help, which service applies, and what the scope and fee would be. No guessing. No pressure."
  - question: "What types of clients do you work with?"
    answer: "I work primarily with small business owners and retailers, freelancers and consultants, founders and partners, and English-speaking individuals with business or consumer disputes. If you’re looking for serious legal guidance and clear deliverables, we’re likely a good fit."
  - question: "What kind of matters do you handle?"
    answer: "I focus on practical, business-oriented civil matters, including business-to-business disputes, unpaid invoices and debt recovery, private loan and lending disputes, contract drafting, review, and enforcement, consumer claims and Small Claims Court preparation, and commercial and VAT-related advisory. If your issue falls outside this scope, I’ll tell you upfront."
  - question: "I don’t speak Hebrew. Is that a problem?"
    answer: "Not at all. I work with English-speaking clients across Israel and handle the Hebrew side of the process for you — documents, correspondence, and legal positioning. Everything is explained clearly in English."
  - question: "Can you help with Small Claims Court in Israel?"
    answer: "Yes — strategically. Lawyers generally cannot represent clients during Small Claims Court hearings in Israel, but I can help you prepare properly, including drafting the claim, structuring arguments, organizing evidence, and planning settlement strategy. Preparation often makes the difference between winning and wasting time."
  - question: "Someone owes me money. What should I do first?"
    answer: "Don’t delay — delay weakens leverage. The right first step depends on the amount involved, whether there’s a contract or written proof, and the debtor’s behavior so far. In many cases, a properly drafted demand letter changes the situation quickly. Message me with the basics and I’ll advise on the smartest next move."
  - question: "Do you go straight to court?"
    answer: "No. Court is a tool — not a default. I first assess legal strength, leverage, cost vs. outcome, and timing. If litigation makes sense, I’ll say so. If it doesn’t, I’ll explain why and propose alternatives."
  - question: "How does pricing work?"
    answer: "Fees are discussed before work begins. You’ll know what’s included, what isn’t, the expected scope, and the cost. No hidden charges. No open-ended billing."
  - question: "Do you work with clients outside Tel Aviv?"
    answer: "Yes. I work nationwide across Israel, and many clients are handled entirely remotely — by WhatsApp, phone, and email. Location is rarely a limitation."
  - question: "What should I send in the first message?"
    answer: "Keep it short: 2–3 lines describing what happened, mention any urgent deadlines, and note if documents exist. You don’t need to write a legal brief — just the facts."
  - question: "Will you tell me honestly if my case is weak?"
    answer: "Yes. You’ll get a real assessment, not encouragement for the sake of billing. If the risk outweighs the benefit, I’ll say so. Clear decisions beat false hope."
  - question: "How do I get started?"
    answer: "Send a short message — WhatsApp is fastest. I’ll reply with whether I can help, your options, and the recommended next step. From there, you decide how to proceed."
