## When a dispute starts, speed and leverage matter

Business disputes don’t usually fail because of the law — they fail because of **bad timing, weak positioning, or wrong escalation**.

I help English-speaking businesses in Israel assess disputes early, identify leverage, and choose the fastest and most effective path — whether that’s negotiation, demand letters, or court action.

### Common disputes I handle

*   **Unpaid invoices** and overdue debts
*   Supplier or distributor disputes
*   Partner or shareholder conflicts
*   Breach of commercial agreements
*   Private loan and lending disputes
*   Cross-border disputes involving Israeli counterparties

### My approach

*   **Fast case triage**: what’s legally strong vs. noise
*   **Written strategy**: options, risks, leverage points
*   **Demand letters** that actually move the other side
*   **Litigation** only when it makes commercial sense

I don’t default to lawsuits. **I default to results.**

> **📌 If someone owes you money, delays payment, or breached an agreement — don’t wait. Delay weakens your position.**

> **📩 Message me with the facts and I’ll outline your best next step.**

### Not sure which service fits?

You don’t need to figure that out alone. Send a short description of the situation and I’ll tell you:

*   whether I can help
*   which service applies
*   what the next step should be

📲 **WhatsApp is the fastest way to start.**
