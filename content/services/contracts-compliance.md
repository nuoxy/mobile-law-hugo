## Contracts should prevent disputes — not create them

Many business disputes start with contracts that were:

*   copied from the internet
*   written for another country
*   unclear about payments, termination, or responsibility

I draft and review contracts with one goal: **make disputes unnecessary — or easy to win if they happen.**

### Contracts I commonly handle

*   Service agreements
*   Supply and distribution contracts
*   Loan and repayment agreements
*   Settlement agreements
*   Commercial amendments and side letters

### What makes my contract work different

*   **Written in clear, enforceable language**
*   **Adapted to Israeli law** (not foreign templates)
*   **Focused on real-world execution**, not legal theory
*   **Designed to protect leverage**, not just “fairness”

If you already have a contract and something feels “off” — it usually is.

> **📩 Send the contract or clause and I’ll tell you where the risk is.**

### Not sure which service fits?

You don’t need to figure that out alone. Send a short description of the situation and I’ll tell you:

*   whether I can help
*   which service applies
*   what the next step should be

📲 **WhatsApp is the fastest way to start.**
