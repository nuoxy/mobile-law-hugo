## Strategic preparation — even when lawyers can’t appear

In Israel’s Small Claims Court, lawyers generally **cannot** represent clients in hearings.

That doesn’t mean you should go in unprepared.

I help English-speaking clients prepare **strong, structured small claims cases** — so you walk into court knowing:

*   what matters legally
*   what to focus on
*   what evidence to present
*   how to argue clearly and confidently

### Typical small claims cases

*   Faulty or misrepresented products
*   Service providers who failed to deliver
*   Refund disputes
*   Overcharging or contract violations
*   Consumer disputes up to the statutory limit

### What I provide

*   Claim drafting and legal framing
*   Evidence organization
*   Argument structure for the hearing
*   Settlement strategy before court

This service is **not** free advice — it’s paid preparation designed to increase your chances of success.

> **📩 Describe the issue briefly and I’ll tell you if small claims is the right route.**

### Not sure which service fits?

You don’t need to figure that out alone. Send a short description of the situation and I’ll tell you:

*   whether I can help
*   which service applies
*   what the next step should be

📲 **WhatsApp is the fastest way to start.**
