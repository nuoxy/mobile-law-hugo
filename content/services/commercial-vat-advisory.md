## Clear legal advice for business decisions — before they become disputes

Running a business in Israel means making decisions under uncertainty: pricing, VAT exposure, contracts, settlements, and regulatory risk.

My role is to reduce that uncertainty and give you a clear legal position you can act on.

I advise English-speaking small businesses, retailers, and founders on commercial and VAT-related issues, with a focus on **practical outcomes, not theory**.

### Typical issues I advise on

*   **VAT exposure** in commercial transactions
*   Whether compensation or settlements are **VAT-exempt**
*   Structuring agreements to reduce tax and dispute risk
*   Responding to VAT authority inquiries or audits
*   Business decisions under time pressure (launches, terminations, settlements)

### What you get

*   **Clear written legal opinion** (not vague guidance)
*   **Risk analysis**: what matters and what doesn’t
*   **Practical recommendation** — not multiple “maybes”
*   **Fast turnaround**, usually same business day

This service is ideal if you need clarity **before** acting, not damage control after the fact.

> **📩 Send your situation in 2–3 lines and I’ll tell you whether advisory is the right step.**

### Not sure which service fits?

You don’t need to figure that out alone. Send a short description of the situation and I’ll tell you:

*   whether I can help
*   which service applies
*   what the next step should be

📲 **WhatsApp is the fastest way to start.**
