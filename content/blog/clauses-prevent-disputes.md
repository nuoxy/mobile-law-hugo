**Note:** This is a sample blog post.

You don't need a 50-page contract to protect yourself. Usually, 3 solid clauses do 80% of the work.

### 1. The "Scope Creep" Clause

Define exactly what is included. More importantly, define what is **NOT** included.

> "Any services outside the Scope listed in Schedule A will be billed at $X/hour."

### 2. The "Late Payment" Hook

Interest acts as a deterrent. Use a standard percentage.

### 3. The "Dispute Resolution" Valve

Don't go straight to court. Require mediation first. It saves thousands.
