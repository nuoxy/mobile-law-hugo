One of the most common questions I get is whether a settlement payment is subject to VAT. Like many tax answers, it depends on the "nature" of the payment.

### Damages vs. Service

If the payment is strictly "damages" for a loss (e.g., breach of contract leading to lost profit), it is generally **outside the scope of VAT**.

However, if the payment is actually "consideration" for doing something (e.g., agreeing to terminate a contract early, or releasing a right), tax authorities often argue it is a **taxable supply** of services.

### Key Factors

1.  **Reciprocity**: Did the payer receive anything in return?
2.  **Direct Link**: Is there a direct link between the payment and a service?
3.  **Contract Wording**: Does the settlement agreement explicitly state the payment is purely for damages?
