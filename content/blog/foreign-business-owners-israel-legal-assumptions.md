Many foreign business owners in Israel don’t lose money because the law is against them.
They lose money because they assume Israeli law works like the system they came from.

**It doesn’t.**

If you run a business in Israel — or do business with Israeli counterparties — certain assumptions that feel “obvious” abroad can quietly destroy leverage, enforceability, and recovery.

Part of our [Foreign Business Legal Guide](/foreign-business-israel/).

Here are the most common (and expensive) ones.

### Assumption #1: “If It’s Legal Back Home, It Works Here Too”

Foreign contracts, templates, and business habits often fail in Israel.

**Common issues:**
*   Governing law clauses that don’t match reality
*   Jurisdiction clauses that are unenforceable in practice
*   Contracts written for common law systems, not Israeli law
*   Missing enforcement mechanisms

Israeli courts apply Israeli law to Israeli activity — regardless of where the template came from.
**A contract that “worked perfectly” abroad can be legally weak here.**

### Assumption #2: “Email or WhatsApp Agreements Are Informal”

In Israel, written digital communication carries real legal weight.

Emails and WhatsApp messages can:
*   Create binding obligations
*   Modify contracts
*   Establish repayment terms
*   Prove admissions

Foreign business owners often underestimate how seriously courts treat these records — until the other side uses them.
**What matters is not the medium, but what the message shows.**

### Assumption #3: “We’ll Sort It Out If There’s a Problem”

This assumption costs more money than almost any other.

Delaying legal positioning leads to:
*   Weakened evidence
*   Loss of leverage
*   Shifting narratives
*   Strategic entrenchment by the other side

Israeli disputes reward early structure, not late reactions.
**Waiting to “see how it develops” usually helps the counterparty — not you.**

### Assumption #4: “Small Claims Court Is Always the Best First Step”

Small Claims Court is attractive — and often misused.

Foreign business owners frequently file there:
*   Without understanding the limits
*   Without preparation
*   Without considering enforcement

Once filed, leverage is often lost.
**Court choice should be strategic — not automatic.**

### Assumption #5: “If We’re Right, Settlement Will Follow”

Being right does not guarantee settlement.

Settlement happens when:
*   Pressure exists
*   Escalation is credible
*   Timing is correct

Foreign parties often assume logic will prevail.
**Israeli disputes respond better to structured legal pressure.**

### Assumption #6: “VAT and Tax Issues Can Be Fixed Later”

VAT exposure often appears after disputes are resolved.

**Common mistakes:**
*   Settlements structured incorrectly
*   Compensation treated as consideration
*   Documentation that triggers tax exposure

Fixing VAT issues after the fact is harder and more expensive.
**Tax positioning should be part of dispute strategy — not an afterthought.**

### Assumption #7: “Good Intentions Will Be Recognized”

Courts don’t rule on intentions.
They rule on documents, conduct, and timing.

Good faith without proof is invisible.
Foreign business owners often rely on trust-based expectations that courts simply don’t recognize.

### Why These Assumptions Persist

Most foreign business owners:
*   Bring habits from common law systems
*   Rely on cultural expectations
*   Underestimate procedural differences
*   Delay legal advice

**None of these are legal defenses.**

### How to Avoid Expensive Mistakes

You don’t need to become an expert in Israeli law.
You need to:
*   Localize contracts and processes
*   Document key decisions early
*   Choose the right forum
*   Structure disputes strategically
*   Understand enforcement realities

**Small adjustments early prevent large losses later.**

### Final Thought

Israeli law is not hostile to foreign business owners.
But it does not forgive assumptions.

If you do business here, your legal strategy must be local — even if your business is global.

Localize your legal position before assumptions turn into losses.
